#HTML presentation tools

There are many HTML presentation tools and they are all created for slightly different reasons. Here's an overview. Please let me know if I forgot any.

##CSSS

CSS-based SlideShow System

##Deck.js

A JavaScript library for building modern HTML presentations. deck.js is flexible enough to let advanced CSS and JavaScript authors craft highly customized decks, but also provides templates and themes for the HTML novice to build a standard slideshow.

##DZSlides

DZSlides is a HTML template to build slides in HTML5 and CSS3.  
'template.html' is the only file you need.  
Shells are extensions. You don't need them for a basic usage.

##Impress

It's a presentation framework based on the power of CSS3 transforms and transitions in modern browsers and inspired by the idea behind prezi.com.

##reveal.js

A CSS 3D slideshow tool for quickly creating good looking HTML presentations. Doesn't rely on any external libraries but highlight.js is included by default for code highlighting.

##S5

S5 is a slide show format based entirely on XHTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With one file, you can run a complete slide show and have a printer-friendly version as well. The markup used for the slides is very simple, highly semantic, and completely accessible. Anyone with even a smidgen of familiarity with HTML or XHTML can look at the markup and figure out how to adapt it to their particular needs. Anyone familiar with CSS can create their own slide show theme. It's totally simple, and it's totally standards-driven.
